/* Game Event
 *    By Kevin Yang
 * 
 * This abstraction seperates game logic from its presentation.
 * Idea: (Publish / Subscribe pattern)
 *   1. Events are defined as members of the DisplayEvent enum.
 *   2. When an event happens, game logic will call a function, and say that:
 *          "An event has occured!"
 *   3. This abstraction will call a function from all the listeners.
 *   4. The functions / listeners will respond to the event.
 * 
 * 
 * Assumes that less than 10 functions will listen for events.
 *
